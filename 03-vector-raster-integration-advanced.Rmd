##About
This lesson explains how to crop a raster using the extent of a vector
shapefile. We will also cover how to extract values from a raster that occur
within a set of polygons, or in a buffer (surrounding) region around a set of
points.

**R Skill Level:** Intermediate - you've got the basics of `R` down.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

##Crop a Raster to Vector Extent
The spatial layers that we have to work with on a project may not all have the 
same extent and create a pretty map.  For example look at this map, based on
four vector shapefiles with data on (field site boundary,
roads/trails, tower location, and study plot locations) and one raster GeoTIFF
file, a Canopy Height Model (CHM) for the Harvard Forest, Massachusettes.  

The plot locations (black & blue crosses) extend off the CHM raster.  The field
site boundary (green square) is so small we can't tell the precise location of 
the tower (black triangle).  

```{r Plot vector-raster overlay, echo=FALSE}

chm_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")

plot(chm_HARV,
     main="Map of Study Plots\n w/ Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest")

plot(lines_HARV, add = TRUE)
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, border="forestgreen", add = TRUE)
plot(plot.locationSp_HARV, add = TRUE)
plot(newPlots_HARV_UTM, col="blue", add=TRUE)
plot(point_HARV, pch=17, add=TRUE)

```

If we wanted a map of just the field site (green square), it would be nice for
visual appeal and file size to get rid of all the data outside the extent of 
the boundary of the green square.  We can do just this using the `crop` function
and the `extent` metadata in our shapefiles.  

Further more, it would be helpful to summarize the mean canopy height within the 
field site boundary or at each of the plot locatations.  This can be done with 
the `extract` function.  This lesson explains how to do all of these.  

#Import Data
We will use four vector shapefiles with data on (field site boundary,
roads/trails, tower location, and study plot locations) and one raster GeoTIFF
file, a Canopy Height Model for the Harvard Forest, Massachusettes. 

If you completed
[Vector Data in R: Open & Plot Shapefiles]({{site.baseurl}}/R/open-shapefile-in-R/)
and [.csv to Shapefile in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/csv-to-shapefile-in-R/)
you may already have these `R` spatial objects. 

```{r load-libraries-data }
#load packages
library(rgdal)  #for vector work; sp package should always load with rgdal. 
library (raster)   #for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters

#set working directory to data folder
#setwd("pathToDirHere")

#Imported in L00: Vector Data in R - Open & Plot Data
# shapefile 
aoiBoundary_HARV <- readOGR("boundaryFiles/HARV/", "HarClip_UTMZ18")
#Import a line shapefile
lines_HARV <- readOGR( "boundaryFiles/HARV/",layer = "HARV_roads")
#Import a point shapefile 
point_HARV <- readOGR("boundaryFiles/HARV/", "HARVtower_UTM18N")

#Imported in L02: .csv to Shapefile in R
#import raster Canopy Height Model (CHM)
chm_HARV <- raster("NEON_RemoteSensing/HARV/CHM/HARV_chmCrop.tif")

```

#Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent
We can use the `crop` function to crop a raster to the extent of another spatial 
object.

```{r Crop-by-vector-extent}

#crop the chm
chm_HARV_BoundCrop <- crop(x = chm_HARV, y = aoiBoundary_HARV)

#view the data in a plot
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, main = "Cropped CHM Raster")
plot(chm_HARV_BoundCrop, add = TRUE)

#lets look at the extent of all of our objects
extent(chm_HARV)
extent(chm_HARV_BoundCrop)
extent(aoiBoundary_HARV)

```

##Challenge: Crop to Vector Points Extent
Crop the Canopy Height Model to the extent of the study plot locations. Then
plot both layers together. 

If you completed
[.csv to Shapefile in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/csv-to-shapefile-in-R/)
you have these locations a the spatial `R` Spatial object
`plot.locationsSp_HARV`.  Otherwise, import the locations from the
`PlotLocations_HARV` shapefile in the downloaded data. 

These are discrete points not a large boundary like with `aoiBoundary_HARV` how
is the extent for the cropping of the raster determined?  
</div>
```{r challenge-code-crop-raster-points, include=TRUE, results="hide", echo=FALSE}

#Created/imported in L02: .csv to Shapefile in R
plot.locationSp_HARV <- readOGR("boundaryFiles/HARV/", "PlotLocations_HARV")

#crop the chm 
CHM_plots_HARVcrop <- crop(x = chm_HARV, y = plot.locationsSp_HARV)

plot(CHM_plots_HARVcrop,
     main="Study Plot Locations\n NEON Harvard Forest")
plot(plot.locationSp_HARV, add=TRUE)

```
</div>

#Draw an Extent
We can also use an `extent` object as input to the `y` argument to `crop()`. 
The `drawExtent()` function is an easy (but imprecise) way to construct an
`extent`object. 

```{r Create-custom-extent-object }
new.extent.draw  <- raster::drawExtent()

```

Or we can set an `extent` manually if we know exactly where we want the extent
to occur. 

```{r hidden-extent-chunk}
#extent format (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)
new.extent <- extent(732161.2, 732238.7, 4713249, 4713333)

```

Once we have defined the extent that we wish to crop our raster to, we can then
use the `crop` function to crop our `chm`. 

```{r crop-using-drawn-extent}

#crop raster
CHM_HARV_manualCrop <- crop(x = chm_HARV, y = new.extent)

#plot extent boundary and newly cropped raster
plot(aoiBoundary_HARV, main = "Manually Cropped Raster\n Harvard Forest")
plot(new.extent, col="darkblue", add = TRUE)
plot(CHM_HARV_manualCrop, add = TRUE)

```

We can see that our manual `new.extent` is smaller than the `aoiBoundary_HARV` 
and that the raster correctly cropped to the manually set extent.  
 
See the documentation for the `extent()` function for more ways
to create an `extent` object.

##Extract Raster Value Based on Vector Layer
Often we want to extract values from a raster layer for particular locations - 
for example, plot locations that we are sampling on the ground. 

To do this, we can use the `extract()` function. We will begin by extracting all
canopy height pixel values located within our `aoiBoundary` polygon which
surrounds the tower located at the NEON Harvard Forest field site.

```{r extract-from-raster}

#extract tree height for AOI
#set df=TRUE to return a data.frame rather than a list of values
tree_height <- extract(x = chm_HARV, y = aoiBoundary_HARV, df=TRUE)

#view the object
head(tree_height)
```

We can use this to view a histogram of tree heights in the study area.

```{r view-extract-histogram}
#view histogram of tree heights in study area
hist(tree_height$HARV_chmCrop, main="Tree Height (m) \nHarvard Forest")

#view summary of values
summary(tree_height$HARV_chmCrop)

```

* Check out the documentation for the `extract()` function for more details 
(`help.search("extract", package = "raster")`).

#Summarize Extracted Raster Values 

The `extract` function returns a `LIST` of values as default. You can tell `R` 
to summarize the data in some way or to return a `data.frame` (`df=TRUE`). 

You can also tell `R` to summarize and return the extracted values. 

```{r summarize-extract }
#extract the average tree height (calculated using the raster pixels)
#located within the AOI polygon
av_tree_height_AOI <- extract(x = chm_HARV, y = aoiBoundary_HARV,
                              fun=mean, df=TRUE)

#view output
av_tree_height_AOI

```


#Extract Data using x,y Locations
We can also extract data from a raster using point locations. We can specify the
buffer region (or area around the point) that we wish to extract pixels from.
Below is code that demonstrates how to do this, using a single point - the
Harvard Forest tower location.

```{r extract-point-to-buffer }

#extract the average tree height (calculated using the raster pixels)
#located within the AOI polygon
av_tree_height_tower <- extract(x = chm_HARV, 
                               y = point_HARV, 
                               buffer=20,
                               fun=mean, 
                               df=TRUE)

#view data
